# Woofr
## A tinder-style application for dog lovers
By Gabe Bizar, Robin Yang, and Danish Bashar

## What is Woofr?
Woofr is a website that acts in a manner similar to tinder. Users create an account on Woofr with an email and password, plus some basic information and a picture of them and their dog. This information is used to create an account card, similar to one you might see on tinder. Once signed in, users can see cards from other users, and choose to "swipe right" or "swipe left" by pressing the corresponding buttons on the card. If two users both swipe right on each other, they are put into a private conversation where they can plan a doggie playdate.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
